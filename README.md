# Real-Time-Abnormal-Event-Detection-And-Tracking-In-Video
The main abnormal behaviors that this project can detect are: Violence, covering camera, Choking, lying down, Running, Motion in restricted areas. It provides much flexibility by allowing users to choose the abnormal behaviors they want to be detected and keeps track of every abnormal event to be reviewed. We used three methods to detect abnormal behaviors: Motion influence map, Pattern recognition models, State event model. For multi-camera tracking, we combined a single camera tracking algorithm with a spatial based algorithm.
